LaserAway Configuration for .env file
============================================

COPY AND PASTE these lines to the END of your .env file:

# LaserAway Email Automation Configuration
# Email account that RECEIVES the LaserAway reports
LASERAWAY_IMAP_SERVER=imap.gmail.com
LASERAWAY_IMAP_PORT=993
LASERAWAY_IMAP_EMAIL=debbie.tanudirjo@directagents.com
LASERAWAY_IMAP_PASSWORD=your-email-app-password-here

# LaserAway Report Email Identification
LASERAWAY_REPORT_SENDER=@tombras.com
LASERAWAY_REPORT_SUBJECT=Affiliate Leads QA - Campaign Filter Report
LASERAWAY_REPORT_ATTACHMENT=Affiliate Leads QA - Campaign Filter*.xlsx

# Date range for processing (days ago from today)
LASERAWAY_START_DAYS_AGO=1
LASERAWAY_END_DAYS_AGO=1

============================================

IMPORTANT: Replace "your-email-app-password-here" with the SAME App Password 
you're using for SENDER_PASSWORD (the Gmail App Password you created earlier).

Since both the receiving email (LaserAway reports) and sending email (notifications) 
are using debbie.tanudirjo@directagents.com, you can use the same App Password.
