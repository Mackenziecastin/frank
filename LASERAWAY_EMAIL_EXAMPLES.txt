KEY METRICS TO MONITOR
================================================================================

1. **Total Pixels Fired**: Should match the number of qualifying sales
   - If "X out of Y" where X < Y, some pixels failed to fire
   - Check log file to see which ones failed and why

2. **Total Net Sales**: Sum of all Net Sales values processed
   - Sanity check: does this seem reasonable?
   - Compare to the actual report if needed

3. **Revenue Share Amount**: Net Sales / 1.75
   - This is what gets sent in the pixel's p= parameter
   - Should always be Total Net Sales √∑ 1.75

4. **Average Revenue per Pixel**: Revenue Share √∑ Number of Pixels
   - Useful for spotting anomalies
   - Example: If normally $1,500-$2,000 but suddenly $50, something may be wrong

================================================================================
TIPS
================================================================================

‚úì Keep these emails in a folder for tracking
‚úì If you see consistent patterns (e.g., always 0 sales on weekends), that's normal
‚úì Set up email filters to organize these notifications
‚úì The log files are kept in the frank/ directory for detailed debugging
